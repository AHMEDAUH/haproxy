# Home Page: Infrastructure Automation Pipelines

## Overview

Welcome to our **Infrastructure Automation Pipelines** documentation. This repository contains two major Jenkins pipelines designed to automate key infrastructure tasks. These pipelines allow you to build custom OS images and deploy HAProxy with high availability and performance. Whether you're working on building OS images for your infrastructure or deploying HAProxy in a highly resilient environment, our pipelines are designed for speed, customization, and flexibility.

### Pipelines Overview:
1. **Image OS Builder Pipeline**  
   - Build custom OS images based on the latest release, with the flexibility to add custom derivations and configurations. This pipeline simplifies the process of creating tailored OS images for your needs.
   - **Key Features:**  
     - Custom OS image builds with the latest release.
     - Flexibility for custom derivations based on user requirements.
     - Integration with GitHub for source code management.
   
2. **HAProxy Deployment Pipeline**  
   - Automate the deployment of HAProxy with high availability, resiliency, and performance. This pipeline compiles HAProxy from source and allows users to provide custom configurations through GitHub repositories. It supports VM port ID import to retain fixed IP addresses using Terraform.
   - **Key Features:**  
     - HAProxy compiled from source for optimization and performance.
     - Custom HAProxy configurations via GitHub repository.
     - Supports **multi-AZ deployment**, **high availability**, and **load balancing**.
     - VM port ID support to retain fixed IP addresses during deployment.

## How to Use the Pipelines

These pipelines are designed to make infrastructure management more efficient and flexible. Here's a high-level overview of how they work:

### Image OS Builder Pipeline
1. **Input Parameters:** Provide the account credentials and desired custom derivations for the OS image.
2. **Build Process:** The pipeline builds a custom OS image based on the latest release, including any required modifications.
3. **Output:** A custom OS image ready for deployment.

### HAProxy Deployment Pipeline
1. **Input Parameters:** Provide the GitHub repository URL for your custom configuration files (like `haproxy.cfg`), along with security settings, node name, ports, and optionally the VM port ID for fixed IP retention.
2. **Build Process:** The pipeline deploys HAProxy with multi-AZ support, ensuring high availability and resiliency, and applies your custom configurations.
3. **Output:** A fully configured HAProxy load balancer, deployed with optimized performance and minimal downtime.

## Benefits

- **Speed & Efficiency:** Both pipelines are optimized for minimal downtime and fast deployment, ensuring that your systems are up and running as quickly as possible.
- **Customizability:** With both pipelines, you can tailor the deployment and configuration process to suit your specific needs, whether that's creating a custom OS image or configuring HAProxy for maximum performance.
- **Resilience & High Availability:** Both pipelines are designed with **high availability** in mind, ensuring that your infrastructure is robust and resistant to failures.
