# Pipeline Documentation: Infra Creation and HAProxy Deployment

## Overview
This pipeline automates the creation of infrastructure and deployment of **HAProxy** from source. The focus of the pipeline is on delivering **high-performance** HAProxy configurations, **high availability**, and **resiliency**. It ensures that HAProxy is deployed efficiently, with an emphasis on rapid deployment and reliable failover between availability zones.

---

## 1. Prerequisites

Before using this pipeline, ensure the following:

- You have access to the **Jenkins server** running the pipeline.
- **SSH key access** to the infrastructure or instances that will be used.
- **Account credentials** are available (username, password, account ID, etc.).
- Required dependencies for **HAProxy** are accessible for compiling from source.

---

## 2. Input Parameters

To use the pipeline, you’ll need to provide the following input parameters:

- **Account Name:** The name of the user account.
- **Account ID:** The unique identifier for the user account.
- **Account User:** The username used for authentication.
- **Account Password:** The password associated with the user account.
- **Service Name:** The name of the service for which HAProxy is being deployed.

These input parameters are used to customize the deployment based on your account and service configuration.

## 3. Steps to Trigger the Pipeline

1. **Access the Jenkins Dashboard:**
   - Navigate to the Jenkins web interface and log in with your credentials.

2. **Select the Infra Creation and HAProxy Deployment Pipeline:**
   - In the Jenkins dashboard, locate the pipeline for deploying infrastructure and HAProxy (e.g., *"Infra and HAProxy Deployment"*).

3. **Enter Input Parameters:**
   - When you trigger the pipeline, you will be prompted to enter the required input parameters (account name, ID, password, and service name).

4. **Start the Build:**
   - Click **Build Now** to start the process. The pipeline will begin the infrastructure creation and HAProxy deployment process based on the provided parameters.

5. **Monitor the Build:**
   - You can monitor the progress of the pipeline via the Jenkins UI. Detailed logs will show each stage of the build process, including infrastructure provisioning, HAProxy compilation, and configuration.

## 4. What Happens During the Build?

### **HAProxy Compilation and Deployment:**
- The pipeline will **compile HAProxy from source**, ensuring that the version deployed is the latest and fully optimized for your environment.
- **High Performance Configuration:** The deployment is designed to ensure HAProxy is optimized for high throughput, minimal latency, and high efficiency. Settings like worker processes, tuning for maximum connections per second, and optimized timeouts ensure the best possible performance under heavy traffic.
  
### **Resiliency & High Availability:**
- **Multi-AZ Deployment:** The pipeline ensures HAProxy is deployed across multiple availability zones (AZs), ensuring high **resiliency** and **fault tolerance**. In case of failure in one zone, the other zones will take over, ensuring continuous availability.
- **Automatic Failover:** The HAProxy configuration is designed for automatic failover between nodes. It leverages **keepalived** or **virtual IPs** to ensure that the active node is always available to handle traffic. This minimizes downtime and maximizes service reliability.
- **Load Balancing:** The load balancer is set up to evenly distribute traffic between nodes, ensuring no single point of failure and that the workload is effectively distributed across your environment.

### **Security & SELinux Configuration:**
- The pipeline configures **SELinux** policies to ensure proper security and operation within a secure environment. SELinux ensures that HAProxy runs with the least privileges, preventing unauthorized access and mitigating security risks.

### **Speed of Deployment:**
- **Efficient Deployment:** The pipeline is optimized for speed. Each step, from HAProxy compilation to node deployment, is streamlined to minimize deployment time. By deploying nodes one by one across availability zones, the pipeline ensures that infrastructure is provisioned quickly without sacrificing reliability.
- **Minimal Downtime:** The deployment process is designed to ensure that HAProxy is up and running with minimal downtime. Configuration updates, if required, are applied seamlessly without impacting the active traffic flow.

## 5. Monitoring & Troubleshooting

### **Build Logs:**
- You can view the logs from the Jenkins build to see detailed information about each step. The logs will include HAProxy compilation details, security configurations, and node deployment status.

### **Common Issues:**
- **Performance Issues:** If HAProxy is not performing as expected, check the log files for any misconfiguration related to connection limits, timeouts, or load balancing.
- **HAProxy Failures:** If HAProxy fails to compile or deploy, check the logs for any errors related to dependencies or environment configuration. Ensure that all required libraries are installed and that your environment meets the prerequisites.
- **Resiliency Issues:** If automatic failover isn't functioning, ensure that keepalived or the failover mechanism is correctly configured.

### **Notifications:**
- The pipeline may send notifications (via email or Slack) to alert users about the build status. This includes notifications if the build fails or completes successfully.

---

## 6. Security Considerations

### **Storing Credentials:**
- Your Jenkins pipeline securely stores sensitive information like account passwords using the **Jenkins credentials plugin**. Credentials are injected into the pipeline securely during the build process.

### **Access Control:**
- Ensure that only authorized users have access to trigger this pipeline in Jenkins. Proper permissions and roles should be set up to prevent unauthorized access to infrastructure creation or sensitive configurations.

## 7. Advanced Features (Optional)

If your pipeline includes advanced features such as automatic scaling or customized HAProxy configurations, document them here:

### **Scaling Infrastructure:**
- The pipeline can automatically scale the infrastructure based on the number of nodes or service demands. This scaling is done in a way that minimizes downtime, allowing for seamless traffic handling as the system grows.

### **HAProxy Configuration Tuning:**
- The pipeline deploys HAProxy with advanced configurations such as:
  - **SSL termination** for secure HTTPS traffic.
  - **HTTP2 support** for faster, more efficient web communication.
  - **Session persistence** for routing users to the same server during their session.
  
### **Health Checks:**
- After deployment, the pipeline performs automated health checks to verify that HAProxy and the infrastructure are functioning as expected. This includes checking HAProxy’s load balancing, SSL configuration, and overall health of the services.

## 8. FAQ

- **Q: How do I ensure high availability for HAProxy?**
   - The pipeline deploys HAProxy across multiple availability zones, ensuring redundancy and automatic failover in case of node or zone failure.

- **Q: How fast will the deployment process be?**
   - The pipeline is optimized for speed. Deployments are typically completed within minutes, ensuring minimal disruption and fast time-to-service.

- **Q: How do I troubleshoot a failed build?**
   - Review the Jenkins logs to identify any issues with HAProxy, SELinux, or node deployment. Logs will provide details to help resolve any issues related to performance or availability.

- **Q: Can I customize HAProxy’s performance tuning?**
   - Yes, the pipeline can be configured to apply specific performance optimizations for HAProxy. Contact the administrator if you need to modify these settings.
